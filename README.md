## Features

- **Daily Metrics**: Displays daily blockchain data, such as transaction volume, number of active addresses, and more.
- **Monthly Metrics**: Provides a monthly overview of blockchain performance, including trends and comparisons.
- **All-Time Metrics**: Presents an aggregate view of the blockchain's historical data and performance.
- **Interactive Graphs**: Utilizes charts and graphs to visualize the blockchain data, making it easier to analyze and interpret.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly and accessible on various devices.

## Flow Explanation

The flow of the Blockchain Metrics Dashboard application is as follows:

1. The user navigates to the `/blockchain` route.
2. The `page.tsx` component is rendered, fetching the blockchain data from the API.
3. The component conditionally renders the loading spinner or the `Graphs` component, depending on the data fetching state.
4. The `Graphs` component utilizes the Recharts library to render the various data visualizations.
5. The application's styling and responsive design are handled by Tailwind CSS.
